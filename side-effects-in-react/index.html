    <p>An operation, function, or expression is said to have a side effect if it modifies some state variable value outside its local environment.<p/>

    <p>In React side effects are anything that changes something outside the scope of a component function.</p>

      /* pseudo code component function signature */
       
      func component = props => element

      /* side effects occur inbetween I/O */

Notes:

https://codesandbox.io/s/practical-buck-b6htm?file=/src/App.js
//infinite loop can be triggered when useEffect does a state update or something that causes the component to re-render and no dep array is provided

//dog api to show making API call w effect

//show multiple API call example w/ algoila search example

//effect clean up example
1. have a conditonal rendering to mount and unmount component
2. have a cleanup function in the effect hook. show console.log of unmounting
3. have the effect function add dom event listener
4. have event listener remove event listener


//retro after teaching

I feel like I may have moved to quickly and not explained the code enough

for example, there's an example where we work with onChange event listener for multiple effects.

I don't think the students had learned about onChange yet and went over it like they knew it.

I also should have more prepared questions.

I did the examples on the spot, and was a bit messy on some spots

maybe a breakout session activity. maybe an idea would be to have the students explain to another student what side effects are and how to use useEffect(what args does it take?)
